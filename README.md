# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to assist Dana with updating her webpage so that it provides users with the ability to conduct an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by filtering the data on multiple search criteria at the same time. The users of this site will be able to narrow table data down by date, city, state, country, and shape of sighting.  

## Results: 
Using Java Script and HTML, Dana's webpage was updated so that the UFO data collected by Dana could be filtered by users on the webpage.  The user can enter one or more of the following search criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of sighting.  A few examples illustrate the functionality for users below: 

- The below picture shows the 'empty' search criteria, each box has a placeholder that gives the user an example to follow when entering in their search criterion:

- When the user enters their criteria to filter the data, the table to the right is filtered once the user hits the enter key, for example here the City was filtered to El Cajon and the state was filtered to CA:

- To clear the search criteria, the user just needs to select the UFO Sightings button at the top of the webpage:

## Summary: 
Any users or ufologists coming to Dana's webpage will be able to filter her table data using multiple criteria at a time.  A drawback of this new design is that the user is currently not able to select multiple fields within a search category. For example the user is not able to select multiple cities, states, countries or shapes when filtering the data, only one city, one state, one country, and/or one single shape can be selected at a time. Some possible ideas for further development would be to make the filtered data easily exportable by the user to a csv or excel file. Another recommendation is have drop down menus available to the user to select their filter criteria.  Having a drop down menu for the date range, cities/states, countries or shapes will give the user an idea of the data that is available in table, without having to scroll through a long list or enter a number of guesses before finding the data that they want to view.
