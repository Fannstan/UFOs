# UFOs
## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to assist Dana with updating her webpage so that it provides users with the ability to conduct an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by filtering the data on multiple search criteria at the same time. The users of this site will be able to narrow table data down by date, city, state, country, and shape of sighting.  

## Results: 
Using Java Script and HTML, Dana's webpage was updated so that the UFO data collected by Dana could be filtered on the webpage.  The user can enter one or more of the following search criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of sighting.  A few examples illustrate the functionality for users below: 

- The below picture shows the 'empty' search criteria, each box has a placeholder that gives the user an example to follow when entering in their search criterion:

- When the user enters their criteria to filter the data, the table to the right is filtered once the user hits the enter key, for example here the City was filtered to El Cajon and the state was filtered to CA:

- To clear the search criteria, the user just needs to select the UFO Sightings button at the top of the webpage:
